# ILITER

__Another (latin: aliter) kind of source highlighter__

This a very opinionated highlighter for my own coding style.
It's primary aim is to be included in my [progressiVecontent] site architecture.

## Main specificities

+ It _ilites_ (sic) only the following sources:
  * JavaScript
  * CSS stylesheets
  * HTML
  * Nunjucks templates
+ It _ilites_ the background, not the front, with semi-transparent colors
+ It ilites also specific lines on-demand
+ It covers only the specific parts of these languages/tools that I use
+ It's not targeting production context
