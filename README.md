# ILITER

__Another (latin: aliter) kind of source highlighter__

This a very opinionated highlighter according to my own coding style.
It's primary aim is to be included in my [progressiVecontent] site architecture.

## Main specifications

+ _ilites_ (sic) only the following sources:
  * JavaScript
  * CSS stylesheets (...soon)
  * HTML (...soon)
  * Nunjucks templates (...soon)
+ smartly _ilites_ background and/or front, with semi-transparent colors and line cursor
+ _ilites_ also specific lines on-demand
+ covers only the specific parts of these languages/tools that I use
+ beta rtelease, not targeting production ready


## Demo site
