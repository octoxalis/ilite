# ILITER

__Another (latin: aliter) kind of source highlighter__

This a very opinionated highlighter according to my own coding style.
It's primary aim is to be included in my [progressiVecontent] site architecture.

## Main specifications

+ It _ilites_ (sic) only the following sources:
  * JavaScript
  * CSS stylesheets (...soon)
  * HTML (...soon)
  * Nunjucks templates (...soon)
+ It smartly _ilites_ background and/or front, with semi-transparent colors and line cursor
+ It _ilites_ also specific lines on-demand
+ It covers only the specific parts of these languages/tools that I use
+ It's a beta rtelease, not targeting production ready


## Demo site

VIsit [iliter page]

+ You only have to select a local file to be _ilited_
+ Change the primary color entering a number value in range [0 - 360]
